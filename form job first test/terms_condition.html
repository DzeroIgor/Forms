                    <h1>Why use terms and conditions?</h1>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of a set of terms and conditions is to record what you have agreed, or to present the inflexible terms
                        under
                        which you will accept business, including those that:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>define the contract</li>
                        <li>set out business procedures</li>
                        <li>protect your business and your rights</li>
                        <li>limit your liability</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you are paid upfront, it still matters that you should have a record of your contract. Quite simply, that you have
                        been paid for the products you've handed over or work you've completed already does not protect you from a later
                        claim.
                    
                        Litigation is stressful, and takes key managers away from the business. Defending a claim can also be expensive. It
                        is
                        easier to have good T&C in place to help avoid litigation, than to defend an unclear contract later.
                    
                        Even if you are selling a low value product or service, a disagreement with a client can take up significant time
                        and
                        possibly lead to reputational damage.

                    <h1>Contents of a T&C document</h1>
                    <p>A well-drawn terms and conditions document should include the following provisions.</p>
                    <h2>Definition of basis or subject matter of the contract</h2>
                    <p>our terms should make clear what you are selling.
                    
                    The products and/or services could be described in detail or by reference to another document, such as a sales brochure
                    or your web site.
                    
                    It is perfectly valid to use general words, such as 'services set out in our web site' or 'the products listed in our
                    catalogue', if your T&C cover various situations.</p>
                    <h2>The price</h2>
                    <p>This should include all variations and circumstances as well as provisions for increase.
                    
                    Because price information is variable from time to time, it is good practice to put it in a separate schedule or refer
                    to it as in 'our price list from time to time', rather than trying to list everything in the body of the document. A
                    reference to 'the prices charged on our web site' is satisfactory here too.
                    
                    Set out conditions under which you may change the purchase price, how you will tell your client about the change and
                    whether it will affect this contract.
                    
                    If you sell a service repeatedly, such as accounting or web hosting, you will need provision for periodic price
                    increases. This should be covered either by splitting the continuous contract into a series of short, fixed price
                    contracts (such as monthly contracts renewed by subscription payments), or by providing for a periodic increase.
                    
                    It will be appropriate for your document to set out the circumstances of the increase and possibly to give notice of it
                    in a way which enables the client to terminate if they do not wish to accept the new price. You may not increase an
                    agreed price unilaterally, any more than your client is able unilaterally to reduce the price.</p>
                    <h2>Payment terms - method and timing of payment acceptable to you</h2>
                    <p>As well as setting out how you want to be paid and when (such as by bank transfer within 14 days of the date of an
                    invoice), your contract should include non-payment and late payment provisions.
                    
                    In cases where an ongoing service, such as web hosting, is provided, these should include default and penalty
                    provisions.</p>
                    <h2>Definition of the services procedures</h2>
                    <p>How much detail you should give depends on your business. There is a fine line between including procedural matters you
                    may change in future and those that will remain unchanged. The former are best on a web page; the later in your T&C.
                    
                    Avoid cluttering your T&C with half promises and sales talk such as 'We will endeavour to provide service 24 hours a
                    day'. Remember that the main purpose of the document is to enhance and protect your interest, not promote your business
                    or protect your customer.</p>
                    <h2>Provisions relating to carriage, delivery, risk and insurance</h2>
                    <p>Every business selling goods has its own T&C to cover this area of activity.
                    
                    Don't generalise with this information. The important thing is to decide what your policy is and include it in the
                    document.</p>
                    <h2>What happens while the contract runs?</h2>
                    <p>This may not be relevant for the sale of goods, but it may be important in a sale of service, for example those of a
                    consultant. These provisions would include reporting, testing, staff to be used and any number of other practical
                    points.
                    
                    These provisions set out the commercial aspects of the deal and will vary greatly from one business to another.</p>
